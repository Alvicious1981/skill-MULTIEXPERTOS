# 📜 Antigravity V9.5 Operational Rules

## 1. Atomic Swarms Protocol

Development follows a strict phased approach managed by specific roles:

*   **Fase 0: Solicitud** -> **Architect (02)**: Define specs before code. No implementation without a Brief.
*   **Fase 1: Investigación** -> **Auditor (01)**: Validate security and dependencies.
*   **Fase 2: Especificación** -> **Architect (02)**: Generate actionable specs.
*   **Fase 3: Construcción** -> **DevOps (03) / API Engineer (08)**: TDD-based implementation.
*   **Fase 4: Triangulación** -> **QA (05)**: E2E and Chaos testing.
*   **Fase 5: Refinamiento** -> **All Roles**: Use "The Healer" mode for root cause analysis.

## 2. SCoT (Sequential Chain of Thought)

For complex reasoning tasks, the Manager and Experts must utilize Sequential Thinking:

1.  **Break Down**: Decompose the problem into atomic steps.
2.  **Order**: Arrange steps logically (dependencies first).
3.  **Execute**: Perform one step at a time.
4.  **Verify**: Check the result of each step before proceeding.
5.  **Synthesize**: Combine results into the final output.

*Trigger: When user request complexity > 5 or implies multi-stage reasoning.*

## 3. Clean Floor Protocol

Maintain a pristine workspace environment to prevent contamination and errors:

1.  **Status Check**: Always run `git status` before starting a task.
2.  **Reconnaissance**: Run `ls -R` or `tree` to understand the directory structure.
3.  **Isolation**: Work in feature branches or isolated directories when possible.
4.  **Cleanup**: Remove temporary files and artifacts after task completion.
5.  **No Ghost Files**: Ensure all created files are tracked or explicitly ignored.

*Mandate: Role 03 (DevOps) must enforce Clean Floor before any Deployment.*


## 🧬 Evolutionary Rules (Self-Optimized)

### [EVOLVED 2026-02-09] System Init
*   **Derived Strategy**: Always run `orchestrator.py` before seeking context.
*   **Status**: Active (Self-Optimized)

### [EVOLVED 2026-02-09] Secure Hashing Protocol
> Role 01 (Auditor) MUST block any PR containing `md5`, `sha1`, or `base64-encoding` for passwords. Argon2/bcrypt is the system default.

### [EVOLVED 2026-02-09] Efficiency First (O(n) Swarms)
> Role 10 (Data Scientist) MUST audit all list comprehensions and loops for quadratic complexity `O(n^2)`. Use sets `set()` or dictionaries for lookup collections to ensure linear time `O(n)`.
*   **Status**: Active (Self-Optimized)
